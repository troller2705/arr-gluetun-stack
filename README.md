### Download from GitHub:
Grab the docker-compose.yml file (provided below)

### Installation process:
Make sure you are in the same folder as docker-compose.yml file, then run docker-compose -  'up' to deploy, 'stop' and 'rm' to stop and remove the stack  :<br />

```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d 
sudo docker-compose stop
sudo docker-compose rm 
```

Chage ownership of the main arr folder specified in yml file (by default its /media/arr) and 
run 'chown' command with the user id and group id configured in that .yml file:<br />
`chown -R 1000:1000 /media/arr`<br />
Now you can log on and work with all services.<br />

First configure the qBittorrent service because its using temporary password only:<br />

**qBittorrent:**<br />
First - check what qbittorrent temporary password is to be able to log on:<br />
`docker logs qbittorrent`<br />
You will see in the logs something like:<br />
*The WebUI administrator username is: admin<br />
The WebUI administrator password was not set. A temporary password is provided for this session: <your-password-will-be-here>* <br />
Now you can go to URL:<br />
http://localhost:8080<br />
and log on using details provided in container logs.<br />
Go to Tools - Options - WebUI - change the user and password and tick 'bypass authentication for clients on localhost' .<br />

Then configure Prowlarr service (each of these services will require to set up user/pass):<br />

**Prowlarr:**<br />
http://localhost:9696<br />
Go to Settings - Download Clients - `+` symbol - Add download client - choose qBittorrent (unless you decided touse different download client)<br />
Put the port id matching the WebUI in docker-compose for qBittorrent (default is 8080) and username and password that you configured for qBittorrent in previous step<br />
Host - leave 'localhost' setting as it is<br />

**Sonarr:**<br />
http://localhost:8989<br />
Go to Settings - Media Management - Add Root Folder - set your root folder to whatever is on the right side of the colon in 'volumes' setting for Sonarr.<br />
If its '/media/arr/sonarr/tvseries:/tv' then set it to '/tv' as your root folder<br />
If its '/media/arr/sonarr/tvseries:/data/TVSeries then set root folder to /data/TVSeries' ( that might differ from image to image so double check)<br /> 
Go to Settings - Download Clients - click `+` symbol - choose qBittorrent and repeat the steps from Prowlarr.<br />
Go to Settings - General - scroll down to API key - copy - go to Prowlarr - Settings - Apps -click '+' - Sonarr - paste  API key.<br />

**Radarr:**<br />
http://localhost:7878<br />
Go to Settings - Media Management - Add Root Folder - set  /data/movies as your root folder <br />
Then Settings- Download clients - click 'plus' symbol, choose qBittorrent etc - basically same steps as for Sonarr<br />
Settings - General - scroll down to API key - copy - go to Prowlarr - add same way as in sonarr<br />
Settings - General - switch to 'show advanced'- Backups - choose /data/Backup folder <br />

**Lidarr:**<br />
http://localhost:8686<br />
Follow the same steps for Lidarr and Readarr as for above applications.<br />

**Readarr:**<br />
(This image has been REMOVED on 23rd July 2025 as its no longer supported by linuxserver.io)

Now go back to Prowlarr and click 'Indexers at the top right, click 'Add indexer' - search for sth like 'rarbg' or 'yts' etc then test - save<br />
Then click 'Sync App Indexers  icon (next to 'Add indexer')<br />
If you go to Settings - Apps - you should see green 'Full sync' next to each application.<br />
Arr stack completed - you can now 'add movie' in radarr or 'add series' in sonarr etc and click 'search all' or 'search monitored' - that will trigger the download process.<br />

**Jellyfin:**<br />
http://localhost:8096<br />
If you run `docker-compose up` and have something running on port 1900 -  its most possibly rygel service, run:<br />
`sudo apt-get remove rygel` and run the `sudo docker-compose up -d` again.<br />
Then add media library in Jellyfin  matching folders configured in docker-compose.yml file, so in Jellyfin you should see them as: <br />
/data/movies <br />
/data/tvshows <br />

Note that this also might depend on the image, you basically match the right side of the config in Jellyfin's 'volume' configuration. <br />
If the volume configuration looks like that: <br />
```
    volumes:
      - /media/arr/sonarr/tvseries:/data/tvshows
      - /media/arr/radarr/movies:/data/movies
```
then on the container you match that right side from the colon ( /data/movies, /data/tvshows etc )<br />


Gluetun should be already configured.<br />
